# Model of a Serotonergic Neuron of the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus

This code, developed in MATLAB by Dr. Henry Tuckwell, is one of the models used in the following work:

Tuckwell HC, Penington NJ. Computational modeling of spike generation in serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus, 2014. [Article available here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2014.04.001).

# Usage

Download all the files. In MATLAB, switch the working directory to the file location and at the command prompt, run the script *SSPONT4APMBK2.m*. It will call the remaining files (functions) as necessary and will produce multiple figures after running.
